# Car-Rental-System
Why is this necessary? For example, when going to another city, you often have to take a taxi. If there are a lot of things to do, then you have to take a taxi 7-8 times a day. Therefore, it will be more convenient for people and will be much cheaper if you rent a car.
It was there that we came up with the idea of a Car rental Management System.
The car rental management system will keep records of all activities and related records centrally.
Goal
Create a car rental website so that to make sure that the user gets their desired car as early as possible, the car rental management system will provide a faster response to complete the process.
Minimize paperwork - since the entire system is computerized, there is no need to fill out any applications for the purpose of renting. Main Features
The following features are the main points that will add two stars to the system, and you will say: yes, I will go for it.
Easy access to customers
Multi-User Account System
Zero customer loss
Monitoring of the entire vehicle control system
Adaptive User Interface
Manage all types of user accounts
Managing vehicle reports
Profile system
Module Description
I've already told you that this will be a multi-user account system in key features. There will be two types of main modules in the system
Administrator
Buyer
Administrator
Like any other management system, the car rental management system will have an administrator. The administrator will be the entity that will monitor the activities and records of the entire system.
Below are some basic facts related to the system administrator.

There will be only one administrator in the system.
The administrator can view the profile of other users.
The administrator will have the right to delete any other users from the records or update the data of any other users.
Any car or payment transaction will be approved by the administrator.


Before moving on to the other modules, let's discuss some common features that will be available in all the other modules.
Registration
Every second user will go through the registration process to register in the system. Below are the required fields that must be filled in to complete the process:

Name-Users will enter their full name or company name.
Password-If you are a user, you will need to enter the password according to your convenience. Use a password that is easy to remember for you. Do not disclose this password to anyone. The reason is that the password will be used to log in to the account, and if some other random person does something unusual with your account. You will be held responsible and some legal action may be taken against you.
Email ID – It is also important to specify the email address of the interested user. This email address will be used for some verification process and as one of the communication methods.
Contact No. – An individual user or company will provide their respective contact details; this may be a mobile phone number or a phone number.


Update your profile
Each individual user in the system will have to update their profile record. These fields are:

Alternative Email Address
Alternative Contact Number
Driver's license information (for the client)
Contact address


View Cars – You, as a customer, can view the lists of cars available in the inventory. The user can filter the car records based on:

Price-Budget is an important factor. It will be easier for me to choose a car, and not to guess what will happen if I choose this car and the price is higher. No tension at all, you can analyze the car record and choose your best car.

Popular cars: If you want to take a car that is popular in the system, and not think about how this car will work, you'd better look into it. Already registered customers gave feedback about their driving experience.

Car Brand: If you are passionate about the brand, you can view the cars of your favorite brand. I took that into account, too. The car brand can be BMW, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Honda, Mahindra, etc. Just choose your choice.

Car Rental – Once you have selected your favorite car, you can fill out the car rental form, which is available online. You just need to fill in some details, such as how many days you want to rent a car, or, if you want to rent it on an hourly basis, the car details of the car model you want to rent. After filling out the rental form, you can pay the appropriate amount using net banking, your credit / debit card.

Rental Car Refund – The customer can return the car, and if all payments are cleared and parts of the cars are not damaged, the customer will be given a number so that the customer can enter this number in the car refund section, and the record will be cleared from the car rental system and moved to the car rental history.

View Rental history – As a user, you can view the history of the rented car in the car rental management system. You can track the amount you spent, the car you drove, the number of cars you rented, etc.

Feedback – As a user, you can share your experience with the car rental management system. How much you loved him or hated him. You can give stars and provide some comments so that the dealer can help the customers in their best possible way.
